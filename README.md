# Algeria Forest Fire Analysis 

The dataset contains 244 records of forest fires in two different regions on Algeria from June to September. It also contains other important features like Temperature, Rain, Wind_Speed, etc. 

This project helped me understand the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering. 
This was followed by feature selection and Model Training. 

The project implements Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso and ElasricNet Regression Models.
